We apply residual interpolation only for air pressure (apress) and air temperature (temper).

Precipitation is interpolated with external data (i.e. elevation). Therefore, the model
reads the plain precip data and the coefficients of residual interpolation, slope and intercept,
are both set to ZERO.
